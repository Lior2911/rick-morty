           The 20 Best Rick And Morty Episodes, Ranked
          </h1>
         <p class="text-success">
        Rick and Morty took the world by storm with its hilarious writing and great story-telling. But which episodes are the best in all the universes?
         </p>
      <p class="text-success">Throughout its five excellent seasons, Rick and Morty has consistently delivered the perfect blend of well-scripted humor and engaging storylines.
        With the show's fifth season having now wrapped, fans of the series will be hoping that season six rolls around sooner rather than later. Given that the fifth season featured some of the best Rick and Morty episodes of all time though, the future of the series is looking pretty bright regardless of how long it takes.

              Back in 1998, McDonald’s launched a limited-edition Szechuan dipping sauce to tie in with the release of Disney’s Mulan. Few noticed when the sauce was quietly discontinued soon after, but one man never gave up hope that it might return. That man was Justin Roiland, co-creator of Rick and Morty, and his love for the sauce was such a running joke in the writers’ room of the hit animated comedy that it made it into the show’s third season as a major plot point. Then things got weird. McDonald’s, never ones to shy away from a publicity stunt, brought Roiland’s favourite condiment back for one day only in 2017. It sold out immediately, and demand was so high in some branches that police had to be called out to deal with fans angrily chanting: “We want sauce.”
